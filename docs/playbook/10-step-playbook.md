# The 10-Step Playbook

## Step 1: Pick an idea that's been done before

Mike's first and most important rule is to pick an idea that has been done before. While most startup culture glorifies novel, groundbreaking concepts, this approach deliberately avoids them. The rationale is simple: choosing an existing business model automatically validates that a market exists and that people are willing to pay for a solution. This single decision dramatically reduces the biggest risk new founders face: building something nobody wants.

## Step 2: Decide what is a good enough MVP

You must analyze your competitors to determine what features their customers want the most. Build a Minimum Viable Product based on those needs and launch it as quickly as possible to start gathering users.

## Step 3: Offer a lifetime deal

Offering a Lifetime Deal for a single-time payment (e.g., $59 or $100) is crucial for generating early revenue.

## Step 4: Never give away an account for free

Always charge people for the product. Paying customers are key because they are more likely to use the product and provide essential feedback, including telling you "why it's crap".

## Step 5: Do as much work as possible to sell a private lifetime deal

Actively promote the private lifetime deal in various communities. This includes working in Reddit groups, private Facebook groups, on X. For example, the launch of Frill raised about 30K from the private lifetime deal phase.

## Step 6: Start writing content

It is critical to start writing content immediately, including landing pages and blog posts, as it is "never too early". Use the capital generated from the lifetime deal to fund this content creation. Write competitor pages and "alternative to" pages. The longer this content remains live, the sooner search engines like Google and tools like ChatGPT will index it and send organic traffic.

## Step 7: Launch on AppSumo or one of the other marketplaces

AppSumo is highly recommended due to its massive reach and huge user database that they can market to. You can either launch on their general marketplace (which has a lower fee) or work with their sales team for their select offering. This step generates many more users and a significant amount of capital. The goal is to close the LTD with $100,000 in your pocket, which should be enough capital to write more content for one or two years.

## Step 8: Do one last private lifetime deal

Once you have completed the AppSumo, execute one final private LTD. Many people want to avoid missing out on a deal. This is the final opportunity to get the lifetime deal before closing it forever. Slightly increase the prices for this final push and send it out to your mailing list.

## Step 9: Get current customers to write honest reviews

This is considered a "live or die moment". Encourage your existing customers to write honest reviews on platforms like G2 or Trustpilot. This is crucial for boosting your domain ranking.

## Step 10: Engage with customers on Reddit and focus on MRR

Focus on answering questions authentically on platforms like Reddit using GummySearch. Scan subreddits to find people asking about your competitors and honestly answer their questions. By this stage, the focus shifts to generating Monthly Recurring Revenue. The ultimate goal is to have enough MRR established to sustain the business before the initial capital runs out.
