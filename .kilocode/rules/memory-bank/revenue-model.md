# Revenue model

The revenue model has not been finalised yet but here are some ideas


### Freemium Strategy:
- **Free Tier**: Basic video recording, manual analysis
- **Professional Tier**: AI insights, limited participant access
- **Enterprise Tier**: Unlimited access, custom integrations, priority support

### Usage-Based Pricing:
- Per-study pricing for occasional users
- Monthly subscriptions for regular researchers
- Enterprise contracts for large organizations
- Revenue sharing with participant recruitment partners
