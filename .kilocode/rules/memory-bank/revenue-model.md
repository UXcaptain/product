# Revenue Model for UXcaptain

This document outlines the recommended revenue model for UXcaptain based on comprehensive market research and competitor analysis.

## Overview

UXcaptain is a video-based user research platform focused on qualitative analytics for UX and product teams. The platform aims to make video-based user research as easy and scalable as sending a survey by providing features such as participant recruitment, video recording, and automated transcription.

## Recommended Revenue Model

Based on competitor analysis and UXcaptain's focus on qualitative analytics for UX/product teams, we recommend a tiered subscription model with the following structure (post-beta).

**Important note (MVP sequencing):** access to an external participant pool is **not available initially** and will be introduced later. The tiers below describe how pricing/limits should evolve **once** the participant pool exists; until then, tiers differentiate primarily on transcription + AI analysis capabilities and support SLAs.

### Free Tier
- **Price:** €0/month
- **Features:**
  - Unlimited studies
  - Unlimited own participants
  - Basic video recording
  - Company-provided email support (up to 72h response)
  - No transcription
  - No AI features
  - No demographic segments
  - Hosted in EU

### Starter Tier
- **Price:** €49/month
- **Features:**
  - Unlimited studies
  - Unlimited own participants
  - Basic video recording
  - Automated transcription (no AI insight extraction)
  - Company-provided email support (up to 48h response)
  - **Participant pool (planned, not yet available):** 5 participants/month

### Pro Tier
- **Price:** €99/month
- **Features:**

### Beta Tier (beta phase only)
- **Price:** TBD (beta pricing)
- **Features:**
  - Unlimited studies
  - Unlimited own participants
  - Basic video recording
  - Automated transcription (no AI insight extraction)

  - **Participant pool:** not available during early beta; introduced later according to roadmap
  - Hosted in EU

## Competitive Positioning Strategy

1. **Against UXtweak**: Offer similar pricing and better transcription quality; add participant pool access when available
2. **Against Userbrain**: Provide better value at similar price point through stronger transcription + clearer AI analysis (insight extraction) differentiation
3. **Against Lookback**: Position as more affordable with reliable core functionality (recording + transcription)
4. **Against PlaybookUX**: Offer simpler, more accessible pricing without pay-per-use complexity; add participant pool later as an included monthly allowance

## Market Positioning

This positions UXcaptain as more affordable than enterprise-focused tools like UserTesting while offering reliable core functionality compared to survey tools and European competitors. The tiered structure targets:

- **Small Teams (2-5 people)**: Starter and Pro tiers address the 45% of Spanish market that works in small teams
- **Sub-€1,000 Budgets**: Competitive pricing for the 35% of market that spends less than €1,000 annually on UX tools
- **European Market**: Local language support and GDPR compliance for European customers
- **Not targeting enterprise**: Enterprise-focused needs (SSO, complex procurement, bespoke contracts) are explicitly out of scope for early pricing/plans

## Revenue Model Advantages

1. **Predictable Recurring Revenue**: Subscription model provides consistent monthly/annual revenue
2. **Scalable Growth**: Tiered structure allows customers to upgrade as their needs grow
3. **Market Penetration**: Free tier attracts users who might later upgrade to paid tiers
4. **Transparent Pricing**: Clear, predictable pricing tiers unlike completely custom pricing of some competitors

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Beta Phase**: During beta, only the Beta tier will be offered
2. **Post-Beta Launch**: Transition to this 3-tier structure after beta period
3. **Feature Roadmap**:
   - Q1: Implement core features for all tiers, focusing on reliable video recording and basic transcription with AI for Starter tier
   - Q2: Add moderated session capabilities
   - Q3: Develop mobile testing features
   - Q4: Enhance integrations with popular UX tools
   - Future: Add advanced AI-powered insight extraction and summarization for Pro tier
4. **Pricing Adjustments**: Monitor competitor pricing changes and adjust annually based on market conditions and feature enhancements
5. **Customer Feedback**: Use customer feedback to refine pricing and features for future iterations

This revenue model leverages UXcaptain's core strengths in reliable video recording and transcription while providing a clear path to monetization across different market segments.
