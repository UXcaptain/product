# Project brief

## What is the project

UXcaptain is a video-based user research platform designed for UX, marketing and product teams to conduct remote usability testing with video recording, automate transcription and analysis of user sessions, and extract actionable insights from participant interactions with prototypes and products.

The platform addresses critical gaps in traditional user research by providing:

- Automated participant recruitment and management  (not yet implemented)
- Remote video-based testing capabilities  
- AI-powered transcription and insight extraction (not yet implemented)
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting  (not yet implemented)

### Primary Users

- **UX researchers** conducting qualitative user studies
- **Product managers** validating user flows and experiences
- **Design teams** testing prototypes and interfaces
- **Marketing teams** understanding customer behavior patterns
- **CX professionals** measuring customer experience quality

## Why This Project Exists

Traditional user research methods face critical barriers that prevent teams from conducting effective, scalable user studies. Organizations struggle with expensive participant recruitment, time-intensive manual analysis, and fragmented tool ecosystems that increase costs without improving outcomes.

UXcaptain eliminates these barriers by providing an all-in-one platform that automates manual processes, reduces costs, and enables teams to conduct regular user research at scale.

## Deliverable

The deliverable is an approximately 15 minute duration video of a participant's screen & audio recording while completing customer-defined tasks - (eg: Try to create an account on <company's> website, find a product on X site under the price of 50€)

## Problems It Solves

1. **High Cost of Traditional User Research**: Traditional in-person usability testing requires dedicated facilities, equipment, and significant staff time
2. **Limited Participant Recruitment**: Finding and managing participants for research studies is time-consuming and expensive
3. **Manual Analysis Bottleneck**: Video analysis and insight extraction is labor-intensive and subjective
4. **Fragmented Research Workflow**: Teams struggle to manage studies, participants, recordings, and insights in one place
5. **Difficulty Scaling Research**: Small teams can't afford the overhead of traditional research methods

## Core Features

Based on market research with 64 UX professionals, the platform prioritizes:

- **AI-Generated Insight Summaries**: Automated synthesis of key findings from video sessions
- **Automated Participant Recruitment**: Platform handles user recruitment automatically with access to external, unbiased participants
- **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard**: Task success rate, time-on-task metrics, and quantitative analysis of qualitative data
- **Question Generation Assistance**: AI-powered question suggestions based on product analysis
- **Moderated Interview Capabilities**: Follow-up conversations with users after analysis
- **Timestamped Note-Taking**: Ability to save insights with time markers in recordings

# Revenue model (draft)

The revenue model is evolving, but pricing is expected to follow a tiered subscription model aligned with Spanish market budgets (notably: 35% of UX professionals spend <€1,000/year on UX tools).

**Important sequencing note:** access to an external participant pool is **not available initially** (MVP) and will be introduced later. Early plans differentiate tiers primarily via transcription + AI analysis capabilities and support SLAs.

**Targeting note:** enterprise-specific needs (SSO, complex procurement, bespoke contracts) are explicitly **out of scope** for early pricing/plans.
