# Project brief

## What is the project

UXcaptain is a video-based user research platform designed for UX and product teams to record, analyze, and extract actionable insights from participant interactions with prototypes and products.

### Primary Users

- UX researchers, product managers, and designers looking to understand how users perceive their products, designs, and experiences

## Why This Project Exists



It exists to solve the critical gap in user research for UX, marketing and product teams. Traditional user testing is expensive, time-consuming, and often fails to capture authentic user behavior and feedback. Organizations need a streamlined way to:

- Recruit participants for user research studies
- Conduct remote usability testing with video recording
- Automate transcription and analysis of user sessions
- Extract actionable insights from user behavior patterns
- Scale user research efforts without proportional cost increases

## Deliverable

The deliverable is an approximately 15 minute duration video of a participant's screen & audio recording while completing customer-defined tasks - (eg: Try to create an account on <company's> website, find a product on X site under the price of 50€)

## Problems It Solves

1. **High Cost of Traditional User Research**: Traditional in-person usability testing requires dedicated facilities, equipment, and significant staff time
2. **Limited Participant Recruitment**: Finding and managing participants for research studies is time-consuming and expensive
3. **Manual Analysis Bottleneck**: Video analysis and insight extraction is labor-intensive and subjective
4. **Fragmented Research Workflow**: Teams struggle to manage studies, participants, recordings, and insights in one place
5. **Difficulty Scaling Research**: Small teams can't afford the overhead of traditional research methods

## Available Features

- Ad-hoc analysis creation
- Participant participation
- Ability for customers to invite participants
