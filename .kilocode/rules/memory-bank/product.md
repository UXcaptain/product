## Why This Project Exists

UXcaptain exists to solve the critical gap in user research for UX and product teams. Traditional user testing is expensive, time-consuming, and often fails to capture authentic user behavior and feedback. Organizations need a streamlined way to:

- Recruit participants for user research studies
- Conduct remote usability testing with video recording
- Automate transcription and analysis of user sessions
- Extract actionable insights from user behavior patterns
- Scale user research efforts without proportional cost increases

The deliverable is a approximately 15 minute video of participants screen & audio recording while completing customer-defined tasks - (eg: Try to create an account on <company's> website, find a product on X site under the price of 50€)

## Problems It Solves

1. **High Cost of Traditional User Research**: Traditional in-person usability testing requires dedicated facilities, equipment, and significant staff time
2. **Limited Participant Recruitment**: Finding and managing participants for research studies is time-consuming and expensive
3. **Manual Analysis Bottleneck**: Video analysis and insight extraction is labor-intensive and subjective
4. **Fragmented Research Workflow**: Teams struggle to manage studies, participants, recordings, and insights in one place
5. **Difficulty Scaling Research**: Small teams can't afford the overhead of traditional research methods

## How It Should Work

### For Research Teams (Customers):
1. **Study Creation**: Design user research studies with specific tasks, scenarios, and participant requirements
2. **Participant Management**: Set participant limits, track completion status
3. **Video Collection**: Participants record their screen and audio while completing tasks

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users (Research Teams):
- **Ease of Use**: Create and launch studies in under 10 minutes
- **Fast Results**: Access to transcribed sessions and preliminary insights within 24 hours
- **Cost Efficiency**: 70% reduction compared to traditional in-person testing
- **Quality Insights**: AI-powered analysis that identifies key patterns and pain points
